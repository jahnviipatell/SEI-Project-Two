- a start page that welcomes them to the website and has an enter button to let them in
- then from there takes you to the home screen where you can have another button if we want that generates a random quote
-once that quote is shown it tells you the author of who wrote the quote
- we will then have a tab that says see more similar quotes 
- this will take you to more quotes of the same category and show about 25 more of them
  - orrrr we maybe have a request that allows the user to choose which genre of quotes they want and then from there we have a separate api request that brings in the info on that genre
- we then have an api that changes the background every time a new quote is generated 







***** QUESTIONS *****
1. Will the background api work, we are only allowed 50 requests per hour i believe
2. It is fine to have multiple requests from the same api? Because we want to display many different genres and there are too many to be able to display them all




***** MVP ******

1. The home screen with the enter button
2. the set interval that changes the background and the quote at the same time
3. navbar with 3/4 genres at the top
4. a similar opition to see other quotes in the same genre on a different page 





***** PSUEDO ******
1. First we will need to figure out the home page and to enter into the generating quote part
2. then we will need to link the button to the xxz
